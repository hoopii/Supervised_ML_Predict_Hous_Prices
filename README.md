# Supevised Machine Learning: Predict Housing Prices
create a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics. Create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not. Create a model to predict the exact price of a house.

# Goal
The task is to create a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics

# Data Set 
Data out of Kaggle competition: 
> "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting"

[Here you can find the dataset and also an overview of the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

# Supevised Machine Learning: Predict Housing Prices
create a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics. Create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not. Create a model to predict the exact price of a house.

# Goal
The task is to create a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics

# Data Set 
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's analternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 
This Dataset is used in the following Kaggle Competition: 
> "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting"

The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 

[Here you can find the dataset and also an overview of the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

# Skills/Methods
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
- Implementation with scikit-learn
